# ProfitTrailer-TheNorthStar-PTMagic-PTDefender_Settings
This are the settings that I use with Profit Trailer and its addons (PT Magic and PT Defender).
Basically what I have here are the North Star settings with implemented Crypto Gnom settings as a SMS in PT Magic for PT Defender ... LOL
In "settings.analyzer.json" file, line 374 "Allowed Markets" change "MDAETH" to pairs that you are defending, can be more than one comma separated ("MDAETH, ZRXETH, ICXETH").
"Allowed Markets" can't be empty otherwise the PTM will crash.
Feel free to modify this settings to suits your needs because they work for me but might not be the best solution for you so use at your own risk.
